# MAUI
- Due to the limit of my github repo, I have compressed the folder into zip file. Please clone and unzip it.

- There several changes compared with the original Boilerplate server template. MS SQL database is required to run boilerplate schema, which will be used to maintein users' information.
- share folder path can be changed to any local path, the folder content will be visiable once user logged in.
- appsettings.json config/string has been changed with the boilerplate database accordingly.
- the port I set is IP:8010 and IF:8011, which is align with the client side (MAUI application).
- need to run boilerplate server project in VS to build server and users can be added from website.
